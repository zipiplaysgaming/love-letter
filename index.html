        It's like I'm not just in love with you, you know like I'm all *yours*, and and I know I've mentioned it alot but the day we kissed is way too magical to not mention multiple times it was so great I loved every moment of it, even though it was so unexpected I never thought we would be doing that even though I was so in love with you.<br><br>
        Thank you for being here for me, and being silly, sweet, soft, loud, stubborn with me, I absolutely love all of those and many more things about you, I wish i could pause the world and spend an eternity with you, and every 'not passing second'( get it cuz the world is frozen) be with you.<br><br>
